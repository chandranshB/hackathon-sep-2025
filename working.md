- **Cellular/LoRaWAN connectivity** for immediate notification
- **Photo capture** when tampering detected (if equipped with camera)
- **GPS tracking** confirms sensor location hasn't changed
- **Community reporting** system for observed tampering
- **Emergency response** team dispatch for critical tampering events

#### Software Security:

#### Data Validation & Tampering Detection:
- **Machine learning algorithms** identify unusual data patterns
- **Cross-validation** between nearby sensors
- **Historical data comparison** to detect anomalies
- **Environmental correlation** (weather, traffic patterns)
- **Statistical outlier detection** in real-time
- **Behavioral analysis** of sensor performance over time

#### Monitoring & Alerts:
- Real-time tamper detection with immediate alerts

- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### 4. Data Collection & Transmission

#### Sampling Strategy:
```
Data Collection Schedule:
├── High-traffic areas: Every 1 minute
├── Moderate areas: Every 5 minutes
├── Background monitoring: Every 15 minutes
└── Emergency mode: Continuous (pollution events)
```

#### Data Format:
```json
