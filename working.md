# Air Quality Monitoring System - Live Data Integration

## Overview
This document outlines how to implement a cost-effective, tamper-resistant air quality monitoring system for real-time data collection and integration with the Clear Air Account platform.

## Sensor Network Architecture

### 1. Primary Air Quality Sensors

#### Recommended Sensors:
- **PMS5003/PMS7003**: Particulate Matter (PM2.5, PM10)
  - Cost: $25-35 per unit
  - Accuracy: ±10μg/m³ @ 0~100μg/m³
  - Lifespan: 3+ years

- **MQ-131 (Ozone)**: O3 Detection
  - Cost: $15-20 per unit
  - Range: 10ppb to 2ppm
  - Response time: <90 seconds

- **MQ-7 (Carbon Monoxide)**: CO Detection
  - Cost: $8-12 per unit
  - Range: 20-2000ppm
  - Sensitivity: 5ppm

- **DHT22/SHT30**: Temperature & Humidity
  - Cost: $5-10 per unit
  - Required for compensation calculations

#### Total sensor cost per node: ~$60-80

### 2. Communication & Processing

#### Microcontroller Options:
- **ESP32-S3**: WiFi/Bluetooth, low power
  - Cost: $8-12
  - Features: Deep sleep, OTA updates, crypto acceleration

- **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**: More processing power for edge analytics
  - Cost: $15-20
  - Features: Linux OS, multiple communication options

#### Connectivity:
- **Primary**: WiFi (existing infrastructure)
- **Backup**: LoRaWAN for remote areas
- **Emergency**: 4G/LTE module for critical nodes

### 3. Anti-Tampering Measures

#### Physical Security:
```
Tamper-Resistant Enclosure Design:
├── IP65 rated weatherproof housing
├── Tamper-evident screws/seals
├── Accelerometer for movement detection
├── Internal temperature monitoring
└── Backup battery with low-power mode
```

#### Software Security:
- **Encrypted Communication**: TLS 1.3 for all data transmission
- **Device Authentication**: Unique certificates per device
- **Data Integrity**: Digital signatures and checksums
- **Secure Boot**: Verified firmware loading only
- **OTA Security**: Signed firmware updates only

#### Monitoring & Alerts:
- Real-time tamper detection
- Irregular data pattern analysis
- Maintenance schedule tracking
- Automated alerts for suspicious activity

### 4. Data Collection & Transmission

#### Sampling Strategy:
```
Data Collection Schedule:
├── High-traffic areas: Every 1 minute
├── Moderate areas: Every 5 minutes
├── Background monitoring: Every 15 minutes
└── Emergency mode: Continuous (pollution events)
```

#### Data Format:
```json
{
  "device_id": "DHN_001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "location": {
    "lat": 30.3165,
    "lon": 78.0322,
    "elevation": 640
  },
  "sensors": {
    "pm25": 45.2,
    "pm10": 78.5,
    "o3": 0.032,
    "co": 1.8,
    "temperature": 22.5,
    "humidity": 65.2
  },
  "metadata": {
    "battery": 87,
    "signal_strength": -65,
    "uptime": 86400,
    "tamper_status": "normal"
  }
}
```

### 5. Cost-Effective Deployment Strategy

#### Network Topology:
- **Mesh Network**: Nodes relay data to reduce infrastructure costs
- **Gateway Nodes**: High-capacity devices for data aggregation
- **Edge Processing**: Local data validation and anomaly detection

#### Estimated Costs:
```
Per Monitoring Node:
├── Sensors: $70
├── Microcontroller: $12
├── Enclosure & Installation: $50
├── Annual Maintenance: $25
└── Total per node: ~$157 (first year)

For 50-node network in Dehradun:
├── Initial Setup: $7,850
├── Annual Operating: $1,250
├── 5-year Total: $12,850
└── Cost per data point: <$0.001
```

## Integration with Clear Air Platform

### 6. Real-time Data Pipeline

#### Data Flow:
```
Sensors → Edge Processing → MQTT Broker → Database → API → Dashboard
```

#### Implementation:
1. **MQTT Broker**: Mosquitto/HiveMQ for real-time messaging
2. **Time-series Database**: InfluxDB for efficient storage
3. **API Gateway**: FastAPI/Express.js for data serving
4. **WebSocket**: Real-time dashboard updates
5. **Caching**: Redis for frequently accessed data

### 7. Data Validation & Quality Control

#### Multi-layer Validation:
- **Sensor Level**: Range checking, calibration curves
- **Edge Level**: Statistical outlier detection
- **Gateway Level**: Cross-sensor validation
- **Server Level**: Historical trend analysis
- **Manual QC**: Expert review of anomalies

#### Calibration Strategy:
- Monthly auto-calibration using reference nodes
- Quarterly manual calibration with certified equipment
- Annual sensor replacement/maintenance cycle

### 8. Scalability & Maintenance

#### Remote Management:
- **OTA Updates**: Secure firmware deployment
- **Remote Diagnostics**: Health monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Predictive Maintenance**: ML-based failure prediction
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic sampling rate adjustment

#### Maintenance Schedule:
```
Daily: Automated health checks
Weekly: Data quality reports
Monthly: Calibration verification
Quarterly: Physical inspection
Annually: Full system audit
```
